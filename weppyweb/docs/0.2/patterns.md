Patterns for weppy
==================

weppy is crafted to fit the needs of a large number of applications, from the smallest to the largest ones. Due to this, your application can start just with a simple python file, and scale to a better organized structure.

In this section we will cover some good *patterns* you may follow when your application starts becoming large, or when you just need to organize your code better.

Package pattern
---------------

The package pattern will make your application a python package instead of a module. For instance, let's assume your original application is structured like that:

```
/myapp
    myapp.py
    /static
        style.css
    /templates
        layout.html
        index.html
        login.html
        ...
```

To convert it to a package application, you should create another folder inside your original *myapp* one, and rename *myapp.py* to *\__init__.py*, ending up with something like this:

```
/myapp
    /myapp
        __init__.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
```

> – ok dude. But what did we gain with this?   
> – *well, now we can organize the code in multiple modules*

With this new structure, we can create a new *views.py* file inside the package and we can move the routed functions to it.   
For example your *\__init__.py* file can look like this:

```python
from weppy import App

app = App(__name__)
import myapp.views
```

and your *views.py* would look like:

```python
from myapp import app

@app.expose("/")
def index():
    # some code
```

Your final structure would be like this:

```
/myapp
    /myapp
        __init__.py
        views.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
```

> – Nice. But how can I run my application right now?

You can use the weppy command inside the original directory of your application:

```bash
$ weppy --app myapp run
```

or you can create a *run.py* file inside your tree:

```
/myapp
    run.py
    /myapp
        __init__.py
        views.py
        /static
            style.css
        /templates
            layout.html
            index.html
            login.html
            ...
```

which can look like this:

```python
from myapp import app

app.run()
```

> **A note regarding circular imports:**   
> Every Python developer hates them, and yet we just added some of them: *views.py* depends on *\__init\__.py*, but *\__init\__.py* imports *views.py*. In general this is a bad idea, but here it is actually fine: we are not actually using the views in *\__init\__.py* but just ensuring the module is imported to expose te functions; also we are doing that at the bottom of the file.

MVC pattern
-----------
The **MVC** (model-view-controller) pattern is widely used on web applications, is well structured and becomes handy when you have big applications.   
Even if weppy doesn't provide controllers, you can implement an MVC pattern using `AppModule` objects. An MVC structure for a weppy application can be something like this:

```
/myapp
    __init__.py
    /controllers
        __init__.py
        main.py
        api.py
    /models
        __init__.py
        user.py
        article.py
    /templates
        layout.html
        index.html
        login.html
        ...
```

as you can see it's an extension of the *package pattern*, where we added the two sub-packages *controllers* and *models* with two empty *\__init__.py* files.

With this structure, your application's *\__init__.py* would look like this:

```python
from weppy import app, DAL

app = App(__name__)
app.url_default_namespace = "main"

db = DAL()
from models.user import User
form models.article import Post
db.define_models([User, Post])

from controllers import main, api
```

as you can see we told weppy to use the *main.py* controller as default for urls, so we can just call `url('index')` instead of `url('main.function')` in our application.

The main controller can look like this:

```python
from myapp import app

@app.expose("/")
def index():
    # code
```

and the *api.py* controller can look like this:

```python
from weppy import AppModule
from myapp import app

api = AppModule(app, 'api', __name__, url_prefix='api')

@api.expose()
def a():
    # code
```
